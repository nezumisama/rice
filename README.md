## This repository contains various configuration file for desktop theming.
See *README* files in different catalogs to learn what are the files in them for.
# Installation
Files can be installed automatically using `install` sh scripts. Each sub-directory contains one such script, which when ran, will install the files from that sub-directory. There's also one in the main directory that will run all other, installing everything.
Install scripts use `cp -pi` to copy files, so they will ask to replace files (so it's safe to run).
Note the script for stylish is an *update* script. See `stylish/README.md` for details.
